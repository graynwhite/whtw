<P>The purpose of this screen is to allow clubs to enter their future activities into a database. This database selects activities that are coming up in the next ten days and displays them on the "Whats Happening This Week: web page at <A HREF="http://graynwhite.com/whtw/whevent.htm"><FONT SIZE=2>http://graynwhite.com/whtw/whevent.htm</FONT></A> this page is usually updated each day. In addition this database creates web pages for certain clubs that are registered with Gray and White Computing that list all of the activities for the club. Flyers or other promotional literature can be also scanned and placed on the internet with references from the event listing. Certain events require reservations in advance and arrangements can be made to display them in advance on the "Whats Happening This Week" page.</P>
