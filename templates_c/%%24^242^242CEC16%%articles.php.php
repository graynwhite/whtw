<h2 >For a Healthy Brain </h2>
<p>Keeping our brains healthy and sharp as we age  is a top priority. But products we use or come in contact with on a  regular basis could damage our brains cell by cell until we eventually  slip into the shadows of dementia. </p>

                    <p>Avoid further injury to your brain by steering clear of these known brain toxins. (See my newsletter <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/32a.cfm" target="new_win"><u>&quot;Maintaining Your Memory&quot; </u></a>for additional information on how to keep your memory sharp.): <br />
</p>
<p><strong>Aluminum.</strong> Avoid all  aluminum-containing foods (processed cheeses, teas with lemon,  pancakes, biscuits and all foods using baking powder), cookware,  medications, vaccinations, and topical ointments. Do not eat foods high  in aluminum when eating or drinking citrus-containing foods and drinks  (orange juice, lemon juice, grapefruit juice, etc). </p>
                    <p><strong>MSG.</strong> It is critical that you  eliminate foods from your diet that contain excitotoxins such as  monosodium glutamate (MSG). It hides under these names: hydrolyzed  protein, soy protein, whey protein extract, natural flavoring, textured  protein, and soy extract. To do this you must avoid processed foods. If  you can�t avoid processed foods, check labels for these disguised  names. </p>
                    <p><strong>Pesticides.</strong> Don't use pesticides and  herbicides, especially within the home. A considerable amount of  evidence links these toxins to increased risk of Alzheimer�s dementia  and especially Parkinson�s disease. Startling evidence shows that  combining pesticides and herbicides greatly increases their toxicity to  the brain, and in sensitive individuals even minute concentrations can  result in advanced and very rapid onset Parkinson�s disease. Instead of  pesticides, choose natural pest-control methods. </p>
                    <p><strong>Vaccinations.</strong> Shun vaccinations,  especially the flu vaccine. With the growing threat of bioterrorism,  public health organizations will be offering a whole host of new  vaccines. I would avoid them all. In newsletters, I have outlined ways  to effectively combat bioterrorism and daily infections without  vaccinations. </p>
                    <p><strong>Fluoride.</strong> Fluoride is a powerful  brain toxin, especially when combined with aluminum. You should avoid  fluoridated water, fluoride toothpaste, and mouthwashes that contain  fluoride. Many natural fluoride-free brands are available. My special  report <a href="http://w3.newsmax.com/blaylock/4a.cfm" target="new_win"><u>&quot;Why Fluoride is Toxic&quot;</u></a>will give you all the details. <br />
                        <br />
                        <strong>Mercury.</strong> Do not let your dentist  fill your teeth with mercury-containing amalgam (looks like metal) or  in any way manipulate your fillings (teeth cleaning, etc). If you have  amalgam fillings, have them removed by a dentist trained in proper  removal procedure. The International Association of Oral Medicine and  Toxicology (IAOMT) trains physicians in this procedure and can give you  the name of a trained dentist near you. </p>
                    <p><strong>Strenuous exercise.</strong> You should  exercise your body regularly, but do not engage in aerobics. They  dramatically increase free-radical generation that can lead to numerous  diseases including neurodegenerative disorders. Several studies have  shown moderate exercise to be protective against Alzheimers dementia  and other neurodegenerative diseases. </p>
                    <p>By following these steps, even if you have  a strong family history of dementia, your risk will be greatly reduced.
