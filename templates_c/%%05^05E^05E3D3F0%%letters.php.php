<h2>Emails from our readers</h2>
<p>Dear Peggy Jo,</p>
<p>I have never met you but I have seen you at many events and I enjoy getting your newsletter every week. I am a 51 year old newly single women. I don't consider myself unattractive . I need your advice.</p>
<p>Recently I attended a very large singles party at a very nice hall. I got there early to save chairs for some friends who were going to meet me there. The group conducted an ice-breaker . I declined to participate. A young man approached me   and I told him that I was not participating in the mixer. He was polite and personable and he asked if he could sit down and I told him it was ok. He was a very good conversationalist and we we got along fine. </p>
<p>When my friends started arriving I stood up to hug and greet them. My new acquaintance also stood up and introduced himself to my friends. He continued to spend his time talking exclusively to me even though he knew my friends were there. A couple times I excused myself to go to the ladies room but each time I returned he was still there.</p>
<p>My dilemma is how does one end a conversation politely but firmly. I did not want to spend my evening talking to him and I found out later that my friends thought I had a date. How would you handle a situation like this?</p>
<p>A.</p>
<p><em>Dear A, </em></p>
<p><em>You should have said It was nice meeting you but I would like to spend some time with my friends now, so excuse me.</em></p>

<p>Dear Peggy Jo, 
  
   <br />
   I just wanted to give you a "heads up" on the GM Ski Club Walleyball Sundays. They are not organizing games or playing during the warm months. They will resume, as their tradition has it, sometime in October or November.<br />
   <br />
Peggy Jo's calendar is an "events bible" for those of us who look for pleasant and inviting things to do and where to meet new friends. I look forward to your weekly email updates, and your accuracy is something all of us value.</p>
<p> As a long-time member and Vice President of the GM Ski Club, I'm requesting that you remove the Walleyball Sundays from your calendar until the games resume in the fall. <br />
</p>
 <p>
   All of us at the GM Ski Club are thrilled that you help promote our club events, but we don't want anyone to be disappointed or angry if they should show up at an event where there is nobody there. I'm sure you agree and know of the consequences if somebody were to question the accuracy of Peggy Jo's Studio for passing out-of-date info on events and activities.</p>
 <p>We would be very happy if you would replace the absent Walleyball event with our upcoming GM Ski Club Picnic for August 14, 2010. Sound good?</p>
 <p> I've enclosed the info below for your convenience. We've had much growth in the last year, lots of new folks, and I'm sure your readers would appreciate hearing about it. 
   
   --- and one of these days, I really must attend one of Gayle's pool parties. 
   
Thanks for your assistance with this matter. This would be an enjoyable event for you to attend as well, hope to see ya there</p>
<p> Ciao!
   
   <br />
  Brian</p>
